# appworx_933_client_linux
A shell wrapper for the java command so the Appworx 9.3.3 client can be run on linux

This script will need to be edited for the location of your Appworx 9.3.3 client install.
It does not contain the client itself. It is simply a wrapper for the java command to launch the client.
